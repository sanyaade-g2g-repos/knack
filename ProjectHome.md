### Description ###

Knack is a modular sound synthesizer, it does Additive and FM synthesis.

This software is developed using C# and the .NET Framework v2.0.
The current version requires Windows 2000/XP/Vista but we plan to port it also to Linux and OSX.

The current version uses Managed DirectSound for output, but we plan to use PortAudioSharp for portable sound output.

### Features ###

  * Different FM operators and waveforms.
  * A stereo delay effect with feedback.
  * Graphic tablet input support.
  * A random note generator.
  * (limited) MIDI input.
